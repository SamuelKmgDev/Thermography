Great project! For anomaly detection and classification on bifacial monocrystalline solar panels using radiometric JPEGs or orthomosaic TIFFs, youâ€™ll want a model that is strong in feature extraction from images, ideally pre-trained on a large dataset, and adaptable to your specific domain.

### 1. **Model Architecture Recommendations**

#### **A. For Classification (Supervised)**
- **ResNet (e.g., ResNet50, ResNet101)**
  - **Why:** Robust, widely used, and available in most deep learning frameworks. Good at extracting features from images.
- **EfficientNet (e.g., EfficientNet-B0 to B7)**
  - **Why:** More parameter-efficient and often achieves better accuracy with fewer resources.
- **DenseNet**
  - **Why:** Good for fine-grained features, which may help with subtle anomalies.

#### **B. For Anomaly Detection (Unsupervised/Semi-supervised)**
- **Autoencoders (Convolutional)**
  - **Why:** Can learn to reconstruct normal images; anomalies show up as high reconstruction error.
- **Vision Transformers (ViT)**
  - **Why:** State-of-the-art for many vision tasks, and can be fine-tuned for anomaly detection/classification.
- **Pre-trained Anomaly Detection Models**
  - **PaDiM, PatchCore, or SPADE** (PyTorch implementations available)
  - **Why:** Specifically designed for industrial anomaly detection, often using ImageNet pre-trained backbones.

### 2. **Transfer Learning Strategy**
- **Start with a model pre-trained on ImageNet** (or similar large dataset).
- **Fine-tune on your solar panel dataset** (radiometric JPEGs or orthomosaics).
- If you have labeled data (anomaly types), use classification. If not, use anomaly detection approaches.

### 3. **Input Data Considerations**
- **Radiometric JPEGs:** Standard CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, etc.) work well.
- **Orthomosaic TIFFs:** If very large, consider tiling the image into patches, then classifying each patch.
- **Radiometric Data:** If you have access to the raw radiometric values (not just RGB), consider using all available channels as input.

### 4. **Recommended Pre-trained Models for Transfer Learning**
- **ResNet50/101 (ImageNet)**
- **EfficientNet-B0/B3 (ImageNet)**
- **DenseNet121 (ImageNet)**
- **ViT-B/16 (ImageNet-21k)**
- **PaDiM, PatchCore, SPADE (for anomaly detection, with ResNet or WideResNet backbones)**

### 5. **Frameworks**
- **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow/Keras** both have these models available for transfer learning.
- For industrial anomaly detection, check out [Anomalib](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib) (PyTorch-based, supports PaDiM, PatchCore, etc.).

## **Summary Table**

| Task Type         | Model (for Transfer Learning) | Notes |
|-------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Classification    | ResNet, EfficientNet, ViT    | Use if you have labeled data |
| Anomaly Detection | PaDiM, PatchCore, SPADE      | Use if you have few/no labels |

## **Next Steps**
1. **Choose a model** (ResNet50 is a safe starting point for classification; PatchCore for anomaly detection).
2. **Prepare your data** (patching for large TIFFs, normalization for radiometric data).
3. **Fine-tune the model** on your dataset.
4. **Evaluate** on a held-out test set.

If you share more about your dataset size, label availability, or specific anomalies, I can give more tailored advice or code examples!
